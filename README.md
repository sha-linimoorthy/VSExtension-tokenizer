# Tokenize Extension for Visual Studio Code

## Overview

Tokenize is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to tokenize text, particularly by expanding contractions and splitting text into individual tokens.

## Features

- Converts contractions into their expanded forms.
- Splits text into individual tokens.
- Displays tokens as an array.

## Usage

1. Open a document in Visual Studio Code.
2. Select the text you want to tokenize.
3. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and search for "Tokenize: Tokenize Selected Text".
4. Press Enter to execute the command.
5. The extension will tokenize the selected text, expanding contractions and displaying the tokens as an array in an output channel.

## Example

For example, the contraction "don't" would be expanded to "do not", and the sentence "I don't like it" would be tokenized as "I do not like it".
